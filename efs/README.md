# EFS Module - Status Report

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Current Issues Found:**

### 1. **Missing App Module Output**
EFS module expects `ecs_security_group_id` from app module, but it's not available yet.

**Error**: 
```
This object does not have an attribute named "ecs_security_group_id"
```

### 2. **Fix Required**
The app module needs to be updated first to export the ECS security group ID.

## ‚úÖ **What's Working:**

1. **Configuration**: EFS Terraform code is syntactically correct
2. **Backend**: S3 backend properly configured  
3. **Remote State**: Successfully reads network module outputs
4. **Resources**: Will create EFS file system, mount targets, and access point

## üîß **Next Steps:**

1. **Update app module** to include missing output:
   ```bash
   cd ../app
   terraform apply
   ```

2. **Then deploy EFS**:
   ```bash
   cd ../efs
   terraform apply  
   ```

## üìã **EFS Module Summary:**

- **Purpose**: Encrypted persistent storage for Forgejo data
- **Integration**: Mounts to ECS tasks via NFS  
- **Security**: Encrypted at rest, network security groups
- **Availability**: Mount targets in multiple AZs

## Usage

1. Initialize Terraform:
```bash
terraform init
```

2. Plan the deployment:
```bash
terraform plan
```

3. Apply the configuration:
```bash
terraform apply
```

## Variables

- `name`: Name prefix for EFS resources
- `creation_token`: Unique token for EFS creation
- `vpc_id`: VPC ID where EFS will be created
- `subnet_ids`: List of subnet IDs for mount targets
- `ecs_security_group_id`: Security group ID for ECS tasks to access EFS

## Outputs

- `file_system_id`: ID of the created EFS file system
- `access_point_id`: ID of the EFS access point
- `mount_target_ids`: List of mount target IDs

## Resources Created

- Encrypted EFS file system
- Mount targets in specified subnets
- EFS access point with POSIX permissions
- Security group allowing NFS access from ECS

## Dependencies

- Requires VPC and subnets to be created first
- Requires ECS security group to be available

## Important Notes

- File system is encrypted at rest for security
- Mount targets are created in private subnets
- Access point provides consistent UID/GID for container access
- NFS traffic (port 2049) is allowed from ECS security group only
- Provides persistent storage for Forgejo data and repositories
